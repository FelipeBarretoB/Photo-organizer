# Photo-organizer

This project is an app that organizes a file of photos depending on how you want them organized. This includes: Name, Type, Camera, date and resolution.
This will create a new folder with a copie of all the photos, a .txt file with the name of who organized the photos, and a .csv with all the photos in the folder "Organized".
